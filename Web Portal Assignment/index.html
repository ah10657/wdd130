    <p>Hello! I am currently a freshman at BYU Idaho, and I am majoring in computer engineering!</p>
    <p>Some of my hobbies include video game collecting, hiking, and I want to get more into baking and cooking!</p>
    <p>I am taking this class because I felt that it would be useful towards my major, and I feel like learning any and all types of programming will be very beneficial!</p>
