        <p>Welcome to the Nintendo Console Chronology page! Here, you can explore the history of Nintendo consoles, from their early days to the latest releases.</p>

        <h4>A Brief Introduction of Nintendo</h4>
        <p>The Nintendo company itself was actually found all the way back on September 23, 1889! They started originally by selling cards that had beautiful art printed on them, and they were called Hanafuda cards, which is translated to "flower cards". Later on, in the 1960's and 70's, Nintendo became a toy company, producing and selling toys in the Japanese market. They even dipped their toes into the video game market in the late 70's and early 80's by making a couple arcade games as well as pong consoles. The first "video game" product that made it to the American market was a series of little handheld systems called the "Game and Watch". Over here, they were actually rebranded as "Time Out", but they were the same games and same hardware.</p>

        <p>This all changed in 1981, when the father of Super Mario himself, Shigeru Miyamoto, created the hit arcade classic "Donkey Kong". It was a smash success, and the Nintendo company decided to shift their focus into video game production. Since then, the rest is history. Nintendo today is one of the biggest contenders in the development of video game hardware and software, and are one of the most recognizable properties on the planet.</p>
