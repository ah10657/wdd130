      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <!-- TODO: Week 07 - Fill in your purpose. In 2â€“3 sentences, write the purpose statement from your elevator pitch -->
      <p>My website will be built for people to quickly and easily access and read light information regarding Nintendo's consoles throughout the years, from their first home console from the 80's all the way up to today. I want to make this site to condense (what I deem to be) the most relevant and useful information regarding each of Nintendo's video game consoles.</p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <!-- TODO: Week 07 - write about your intended audience. Who are they? How old are they? Why will they be using your site? What do you want them to do? -->
      <p>My target demographic are people who want to gain some trivia about their favorite consoles, as well as people who's family members may have an interest in retro games and want to learn more about them so that they can be more involved in their family members' retro gaming hobbies. I want to make it so simple so that someone's grandma could read it and understand what their grandchild is talking about.</p>

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        <!-- TODO: Week 08 - change this -->
        On the home page, I will welcome my site's visitors and lay down what the purpose of the site is, which is to be a fun, entertaining way to learn more about all of Nintendo's consoles that they have made throughout the years focusing on North American figures. (Japan and Europe have slightly different statistics, which I don't really know as much about, mostly because I'm an American myself) I just want to make something that feels approachable by everyone, and doesn't get too in depth about the more niche aspects about the consoles that most people wouldn't really care about. As you scroll down, I plan on having a timeline with a clickable image of every console (I'll be sure to lay it out better on the wireframe for the site, I have a pretty cool idea for how to display it). Near the bottom of the front page, I'll show statistics to help the readers quickly differentiate the consoles (i.e. total console sales, pointing out how more popular consoles sold better than others). What I want my site visitors to get from this site is quick, fun, and informative information regarding their favorite consoles. Hopefully my website will be inviting, informative, and easy access to anyone, giving people a concise compilation of lots of information in one place. This will NOT be like a Wikipedia site, with loads and loads of information. Just something light-hearted and fun for anyone to get a quick scoop on information that they might be looking for. I'll try to provide links to facts I include in case anyone wants to further study it, which I completely condone and suggest everybody to do. This site is to serve as a sort of barrier of entry for new people who want to get into learning about Nintendo games and consoles.

      <h3>SUBPAGES DEDICATED TO EACH CONSOLE</h3>
      <p>For these subpages, each one will be dedicated to a system. There will be an introductory paragraph that will paint a picture to the reader about why the console came to be, how popular it was, and maybe list some titles and genres that are associated with the console. Down the page, there will be fun little factoids that are interesting to know (e.g. Tetris was picked over Super Mario Land to be the pack-in title for the original Game Boy). I have been kicking around the idea of stylizing each page for era that the console came in, so I might style the pages for the consoles from the 80's with a vaporwave aesthetic, meanwhile the 90's will have it's iconic grudge, edgy phase that was popular to the older kids and teens at the time. I'll also include something like the top 10 games (based on number of sales) for each console, and I'll also include things like launch titles, pack-in titles, and the final game that was released on the consoles. I'll show an image of the console, the controller(s) related to it, and what a game system would look like.

        After talking with Brother Bagley about this today (3/3), he showed me an interesting idea of just compiling all of this information onto one page, and with that in mind, I think that I will put the more generic information down as such on this one page, and maybe have links throughout that lead to subpages that all share similar topics that multiple consoles share.</p>

      <h3>SUBPAGES COVERING BROADER TOPICS</h3>
      <p>
        <!-- TODO: Week 08 - change this -->
        I'll also have a subpage that covers more broader strokes of Nintendo's consoles, like pointing out why some were more successful than others. I'll have something that shows the overall console sales throughout their respective lifespans on the market, and give insights - mostly from my personal opinion, but backed with some facts that I have based my opinion from - as to why a console performed so well or why another didn't. I'll probably have another subpage that covers the difference between Nintendo's home consoles and handheld consoles, how each one has their strengths and what they have done for Nintendo. I'll also include a small section or make another subpage that gives a quick breakdown of each of Nintendo's franchises, like Mario and Zelda. Nothing crazy, but maybe a description of the genre, gameplay, and the characters.

      <h2>Wireframes</h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
        here
      </p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>
        <!-- TODO: Week 09 - change this -->
        The big box in the bottom right-ish corner of the page will be a slideshow, periodically shifting through each little tidbit about each console. The left side will be a timeline that when clicked, will take you to the console's slide in the slideshow.
      </p>

      <h3>Console Sales Page</h3>
      <p>
        <!-- TODO: Week 09 - change this -->
        Nothing really crazy here. Just an informational page.

        <!-- TODO: Week 09 - change this -->
        Again, just like the Console Sales Page, just an informational page.
