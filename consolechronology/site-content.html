    <h1>MAIN POINTS FOR MY WEBSITE:</h1>

    <h2>HOMEPAGE:</h2>
    <!-- <p>On the home page, I will welcome my site's visitors and lay down what the purpose of the site is, which is to be a fun, entertaining way to learn more about all of Nintendo's consoles that they have made throughout the years focusing on North American figures. (Japan and Europe have slightly different statistics, which I don't really know as much about, mostly because I'm an American myself) I just want to make something that feels approachable by everyone, and doesn't get too in depth about the more niche aspects about the consoles that most people wouldn't really care about. As you scroll down, I plan on having a timeline with a clickable image of every console (I'll be sure to lay it out better on the wireframe for the site, I have a pretty cool idea for how to display it). Near the bottom of the front page, I'll show statistics to help the readers quickly differentiate the consoles (i.e. total console sales, pointing out how more popular consoles sold better than others). What I want my site visitors to get from this site is quick, fun, and informative information regarding their favorite consoles. Hopefully my website will be inviting, informative, and easy access to anyone, giving people a concise compilation of lots of information in one place. This will NOT be like a Wikipedia site, with loads and loads of information. Just something light-hearted and fun for anyone to get a quick scoop on information that they might be looking for. I'll try to provide links to facts I include in case anyone wants to further study it, which I completely condone and suggest everybody to do. This site is to serve as a sort of barrier of entry for new people who want to get into learning about Nintendo games and consoles.</p> -->

    <p>Hello and welcome to the Nintendo Console Chronology! This page is dedicated to those who want to learn more about their favorite Nintendo systems, as well as for those who want to delve into the world of Nintendo throughout the decades!</p>

    <p>The Nintendo company itself was actually found all the way back on September 23, 1889! They started originally by selling cards that had beautiful art printed on them, and they were called Hanafuda cards, which is translated to "flower cards". Later on, in the 1960's and 70's, Nintendo became a toy company, producing and selling toys in the Japanese market. They even dipped their toes into the video game market in the late 70's and early 80's by making a couple arcade games as well as pong consoles. The first "video game" product that made it to the American market was a series of little handheld systems called the "Game and Watch". Over here, they were actually rebranded as "Time Out", but they were the same games and same hardware.</p>

    <p>This all changed in 1981, when the father of Super Mario himself, Shigeru Miyamoto, created the hit arcade classic "Donkey Kong". It was a smash success, and the Nintendo company decided to shift their focus into video game production. Since then, the rest is history. Nintendo today is one of the biggest contenders in the development of video game hardware and software, and are one of the most recognizable properties on the planet.</p>

    <h4>1985 - Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)</h4>
    <p>The NES was a breakthrough system in the video game market. Following the video game crash of 1983, when system like the Atari 2600 was oversaturating the market with pretty lackluster games, most of the video game market dwindled, and home consoles were considered a fad while arcades were the better experience. However, Nintendo came to the burning building that was the video game market and quenched the flames with the release of the NES. They initially marketed the system as more of a digital interactive toy rather than a game system, using a product called R.O.B. the Robot. He was used as a peripheral that you would prop up and watch the TV screen with you and play co-op games with you. The first system release included the NES system, two controllers, R.O.B. and his accessories, a Nintendo Zapper(&copy), and two games: Gyromite, and Duck Hunt. Later on, however, after the initial release brought lots of interest to the console, Nintendo switched out R.O.B. and replaced his game of gyromite with the real console seller: Super Mario Bros.</p>

    <h4>1989 - Nintendo GameBoy</h4>

    <h2>SUBPAGES DEDICATED TO EACH CONSOLE</h2>
    <p>For these subpages, each one will be dedicated to a system. There will be an introductory paragraph that will paint a picture to the reader about why the console came to be, how popular it was, and maybe list some titles and genres that are associated with the console. Down the page, there will be fun little factoids that are interesting to know (e.g. Tetris was picked over Super Mario Land to be the pack-in title for the original Game Boy). I have been kicking around the idea of stylizing each page for era that the console came in, so I might style the pages for the consoles from the 80's with a vaporwave aesthetic, meanwhile the 90's will have it's iconic grudge, edgy phase that was popular to the older kids and teens at the time. I'll also include something like the top 10 games (based on number of sales) for each console, and I'll also include things like launch titles, pack-in titles, and the final game that was released on the consoles. I'll show an image of the console, the controller(s) related to it, and what a game system would look like.

    After talking with Brother Bagley about this today (3/3), he showed me an interesting idea of just compiling all of this information onto one page, and with that in mind, I think that I will put the more generic information down as such on this one page, and maybe have links throughout that lead to subpages that all share similar topics that multiple consoles share.
    </p>

    <h2>SUBPAGES COVERING BROADER TOPICS</h2>
    <p>I'll also have a subpage that covers more broader strokes of Nintendo's consoles, like pointing out why some were more successful than others. I'll have something that shows the overall console sales throughout their respective lifespans on the market, and give insights - mostly from my personal opinion, but backed with some facts that I have based my opinion from - as to why a console performed so well or why another didn't. I'll probably have another subpage that covers the difference between Nintendo's home consoles and handheld consoles, how each one has their strengths and what they have done for Nintendo. I'll also include a small section or make another subpage that gives a quick breakdown of each of Nintendo's franchises, like Mario and Zelda. Nothing crazy, but maybe a description of the genre, gameplay, and the characters.</p>

    <p>After looking at all of this, I understand that this is shaping up to be a much bigger project than I even originally anticipated, but I will do what I need to for the assignment, and I will probably even continue working on this after this class ends. I really think I might have a good idea for something here, so I'll definitely keep it going afterwards. I might even add other things later, like links to the freshest articles surrounding Nintendo's affairs.</p>
