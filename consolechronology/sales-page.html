            <p> Nintendo's innovation is not just limited to hardware, however. The company has also been a pioneer in software development, creating some of the most beloved and iconic games of all time.

            <h4>Signs that a console is successful</h4>
            <div id="right">
            <p>Positive Publicity: If a console is getting a lot of positive publicity, it is likely doing well in the market. This can include reviews from gaming websites, social media buzz, and word-of-mouth recommendations from friends and family.</p>

            <p>Sales Numbers: If a console is selling well, it is likely doing well in the market. This can include sales numbers from  retailers, as well as sales numbers from the manufacturer.</p>

            <p>3rd Party Support: If a console is getting a lot of support from 3rd party developers, it is likely doing well in the market. This can include announcements of new games, as well as partnerships with other companies.</p>

            <p>Console Reiterations: If a console is selling well, Nintendo usually goes back to the drawing board and creates a new and updated version of the console on the market. These images on the left here are updated versions of the NES and the Wii. The NES toploader had some hardware improvements that made the console run better, and the Wii Mini was a cheaper bare-bones Wii to bring down cost.</p>

            <p>Console Variants: If a console is getting a lot of variants, mostly cosmetic changes that don't give any advantage over the base product, it is likely doing well in the market. This can include special editions, limited editions, and bundles with other products.</p>

            <p>Shovelware: If a console is receiving a significant amount of shovelware, it may indicate strong market performance. Shovelware refers to games that are often low-quality or quickly produced to capitalize on a console's popularity. While these games may not be critically acclaimed, their presence can signal that developers see the console as a lucrative platform due to its widespread adoption and booming sales.</p>
