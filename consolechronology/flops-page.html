            <div id="left">
                <p>Nintendo isn't a flawless company. Everyone makes mistakes and missteps. Nintendo is no different. In the course of trying something new, unforseen shortcomings and poor execution will always bring a product short of what it was projected to be. On this page, I will list three of (what I consider to be) the most significant flops that most may or may not know about.</p>

                <p>The 64DD, a failed add-on for the Nintendo 64</p>

            <h4>Innovation isn't easy</h4>
            <div id="right">
                <p>This may go without saying, but inventing something new and trying out new things even if they might not be the best idea is still a sign of a healthy mindset and strong company. Sure, it would be great to bring about innovative things like the Wii Remote every couple of years, but the fact that Nintendo had the willingness to try and not suffer completely from the losses shows that they have faith in their research and development departments and has a forward thinking company mindset.</p>

            <h4>Virtual Boy<br>Underdeveloped and ahead of its time</h4>
            <div id="vb">
            <p>An attempt was made at VR in 1995... the more development that went into it, the quicker Nintendo realized that this was going to be expensive to produce, so some features had some corners cut.</p>

            <p>It was a 3D system that was supposed to be a VR system, but it was just a red and black screen with no color. People were also concerned about motion sickness and epileptic triggers due to long play times.</p>

            <p>It was a huge failure, and it was discontinued after only a year on the market.</p>

            <h4>Nintendo 64<br>Overhyped, didn't meet expectations</h4>
            <div id="n64">
            <p>The Nintendo 64 was a huge leap forward in terms of graphics and gameplay, but it was also a huge disappointment. The system was plagued by delays, and when it finally released, it was missing a lot of the features that were promised. The system also had a very limited library of games, which made it difficult for gamers to find something to play.</p>

            <p>The Nintendo 64 was also very expensive, which made it difficult for gamers to justify the purchase. The system was also very difficult to develop for, which made it difficult for developers to create games for the system. The Nintendo 64 was a huge disappointment, and it was a huge failure for Nintendo.</p>

            <img class="example" src="images/wiiu.png" alt="Nintendo Wii U">

            <h4>Wii U<br>Anything that can go wrong will go wrong</h4>
            <div id="wiiu">
            <p>The Wii U is probably Nintendo's most significant failure. It's considered to be a super safe and lazy follow up to the Wii, capitalizing off of its popularity.</p>

            <p>The marketing and reveal was considered confusing and misleading, since many of the advertisements shown only the Wii U Gamepad, a lot of people considered that it was just a peripheral that you bought for your Wii.</p>
            
            <p>People didn't see much value in getting the Wii U since the Wii in the later years didn't maintain its initial luster that it had at launch. The Wii U was marketed towards EVERYONE, since the Wii appealed to people who didn't consider themselves to be serious gamers. Nintendo throughout the Wii U's lifespan just couldn't ever decide to make it appeal more to the hardcore gamers or to the general public.</p>
